# üß† Mandala-Healing: Self-Evolving Knowledge Refinement for Language Models

> Post-training self-healing method for large language models based on Mandala symmetry analysis and autonomous knowledge refinement.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

Traditional large language models (LLMs) are trained once on massive datasets,  
then often remain static ‚Äî even if they have internal contradictions, missing facts, or logical inconsistencies.

There is **no natural way for models to repair themselves** once training is finished.  
Until now.

**Mandala-Healing** introduces a **new post-training phase**:

- Analyze the model‚Äôs **internal knowledge geometry**,
- Detect **weak or fragile branches** where knowledge is broken or missing,
- Trigger **self-healing cycles** ‚Äî where the model generates sub-questions and simulations to fill gaps,
- **Test** if the healing improves answers,
- **Permanently inject** safe, minimal corrections into model weights.

This repository provides a working **proof-of-concept** system for Mandala-Healing,  
fully **open-source**, **transparent**, and **extendable**.

## üß© Mandala-Healing Principles

**Mandala-Healing** treats a trained language model like a living, evolving system.

- A model‚Äôs internal knowledge is structured as a **Mandala** ‚Äî  
  a complex geometric map of facts, concepts, and logical relationships.

- **Healthy knowledge** appears as **symmetrical, well-organized branches**.

- **Broken knowledge** (missing facts, hallucinations, contradictions) manifests as **asymmetries, distortions, or fragile branches**.

By detecting and healing these weak areas,  
the model can **self-perfect** over time ‚Äî without human intervention.

### üõ† The Core Healing Cycle

1. **Visualize Knowledge** ‚Äî Project internal activations into a Mandala using UMAP/t-SNE.
2. **Detect Fragility** ‚Äî Identify asymmetric or broken knowledge branches.
3. **Self-Ask and Simulate** ‚Äî Model generates sub-questions and imagined answers internally.
4. **Self-Heal** ‚Äî Propose small memory corrections (e.g., bias vector updates).
5. **Self-Test** ‚Äî Healing is accepted only if internal testing shows real answer improvement.
6. **Permanent Repair** ‚Äî Safe healing edits are injected directly into model weights.

## üî• What Makes Mandala-Healing Different

- **Self-generated healing.**  
  Healing comes from inside the model ‚Äî no external datasets needed.

- **Minimal invasive edits.**  
  Small corrections (e.g., bias adjustments) instead of expensive full retraining.

- **Geometry becomes intelligence.**  
  Symmetry and balance of the Mandala reflect real knowledge health.

- **True self-evolution.**  
  The model can autonomously refine itself, repair errors, and grow smarter over time.

- **Healing across multiple projections.**  
  One view is not enough ‚Äî Mandala-Healing explores different angles, layers, and projections to build a robust self-healing process.

> It is not prompt engineering.  
> It is the next evolutionary step: models that can grow, heal, and evolve on their own.**
