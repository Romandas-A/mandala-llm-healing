# üß† Mandala-Healing: Self-Evolving Knowledge Refinement for Language Models

> Post-training self-healing method for large-language models based on mandala symmetry analysis and autonomous knowledge refinement.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

Traditional large-language models (LLMs) are trained once on massive datasets,  
then often remain static‚Äîeven if they have internal contradictions, missing facts, or inconsistent logic.

**Mandala-Healing** proposes a **new post-training phase**:

- Analyze the model‚Äôs **internal knowledge geometry**,
- Detect **weak branches** where knowledge is broken or missing,
- Trigger **self-healing** cycles ‚Äî where the model generates sub-questions and simulations to fill gaps,
- **Test** if the healing improves answers,
- **Permanently inject** safe corrections into model weights.

This repository contains real, working prototype code for Mandala-Healing,  
designed to be fully **open-source**, **transparent**, and **extendable**.
